DONE ===>
1) CREATE EXPRESS SERVER THAT HAS SPECIFIC ROUTES
2) MAKE GET REQUEST TO THE REQUIRED API SERVICE PROVIDERS - LIKE IMDB API OR TMDB API ETC
3) MANIPULATE RESPONSE FROM THESE API TO GET THE REQUIRED DATA - like fetch all - fetch first x - fetch in a given range - ALL THESE ARE DONE BY IDENTIFYING THE PARAMS IN THE URL 
4) AT MAX CAN MAKE 100 REQUESTS TO IMDB API PER DAY - SO MAKE REQUESTS USING MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS OR THREADS. Used accounts - see in dotenv file with their passwords - cycled through these API keys - see any one of the controller files
5) INTEGRATE IN THEATRES API WITH FRONTEND
6) INTEGRATE YOUTUBE TRAILER api WITH FRONTEND TO RENDER YOUTUBE TRAILER

ISSUES ===>
1) ECONNRESET = The TMDB api - I guess is banned in India - so the backend sends a first request to the API and then the connection is closed off.
We need to restart the server and make a whole new fresh request to the API. Could not find any solution to this unless using a VPN which might not be possible
once I host the backend on heroku. So tried sending request to the IMDB api from frontend and suprisingly it worked. Still not sure how but it does. So the 
whole content of featured section (THE CAROUSEL ON THE HOMEPAGE) is fetched from the frontend side.
2) CORS error - Got to know what this infamous error is about - Every browser blocks this by default as part of its security model. It
can be allowed if the client(frontend side) request Origin header matches the server(backend side) response Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.
For now I am allowing all origins to access the backend so the cors orginis header is set to "*" in the backend.
Check server.js file for the cors origin header.

PENDING ===>
1) MAKE SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY git
